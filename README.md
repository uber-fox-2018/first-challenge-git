# Latar Belakang
My name is Odelia and I have been working and involved in marketing divisions as well as the music/entertainment events industry. Despite having no IT background, I left my previous job to pursue an education in programming.

# Motivasi
I want to learn additional skills. With the tech industry moving and changing rapidly, I believe having this skill will be beneficial in the long-run. I also hope to be able to enhance my currently existing events business or at least get a better career.

# Ekspektasi
To learn and apply the skills that I've learned to real life situations and to get better after repeating phase 1.
